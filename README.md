# ShipGame
This is just a small, simple game that my friend and I are making. The basic gameplay is that the players (if on multiplayer) fly around and shoot eachother or the objects that spawn. This entirely depends on the server settings that the host chooses, and if the player is on single player, they can just fly around and have fun shooting stuff.

The following libraries were used for this game:

sock.lua - https://github.com/camchenry/sock.lua

HUMP (vector.lua) - https://github.com/vrld/hump

HC (the collision library) - https://github.com/vrld/HC

bitser (used with sock.lua) - https://github.com/gvx/bitser

anim8 (the animation library) - https://github.com/kikito/anim8
